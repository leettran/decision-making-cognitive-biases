Bias arises from various processes that are sometimes difficult to distinguish. These include

* information-processing shortcuts (heuristics)
* noisy information processing (distortions in the process of storage in and retrieval from memory)
* the brain's limited information processing capacity
* emotional and moral motivations
* social influence

Biases can be distinguished on a number of dimensions. For example,

* there are biases specific to groups (such as the risky shift) as well as biases at the individual level.
* Some biases affect decision-making, where the desirability of options has to be considered (e.g., sunk costs fallacy).
* Others such as illusory correlation affect judgment of how likely something is, or of whether one thing is the cause of another.
* A distinctive class of biases affect memory, such as consistency bias (remembering one's past attitudes and behavior as more similar to one's present attitudes).
